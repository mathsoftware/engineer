Math Software Engineer's static files.

This branch contains some of the most valuable arts I have created in these 
years. I am finally making my works public, so here we are.

I am not going to make Piaxid logos or PSD source files public available yet 
this year.

## Further Details

If you want to know how to use my logos or trademarks, I suggest reading 
[GitHub Logos and Usage](https://github.com/logos) for example.
