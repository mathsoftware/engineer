# Representation

Mathematical models are abstract, but they can be represented via graphics
by applying math software engineering.

Representation is the art of consuming mathematical models via an interface,
such that is useful for the consumer.

For example:

- A mathematician requires model visualization.
- A data scientist requires data visualization.
- An astrophysicist requires celestial body visualizations that infer
  computations from mere measurements or numbers and that must filter out
  millions of unnecessary data for the human astrophysicists.
